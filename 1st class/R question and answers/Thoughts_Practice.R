## What we learned:
  ## What are scalars, Vectors
  ## data type of scalars, vectors, and rule of coercision
  ## understood ellipsis and problem with mean function without using 'c'
  ## Understood 'c' function in detail
  ## vector concatenation
  ## paste and paste0 with sep and collapse
  ## adding two similar and different length vectors
  ## vectorization for two different length vectors
  ## subsetting of vectors using boolean expression
  ## boolean & and boolean |
  ## Some non explained functions(which we will discuss in great detail later): example grepl, str_extract and str_extract_all, str_view and str_view_all --> PLEASE DON"T WORRY ABOUT THEM FOR NOW
  ## Usage of : and seq function with by and length parameters
  ## as.numeric, length and nchar functions
  ## understood the option: scipen = 999 due to which nchar gives wrong result for pure numbers

## some questions:
  ## Q1 Create a vector of length 10 between number -1 to 1
  ## Q2 c('one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'), deterermine the length of each string in given vector
  ## Q3 Add and Multiply these two(A and B) and explain the outcome : A = c(1,3,4,8,9) , B= c(1,3)
  ## Q4 Extract odd numbers from a sequence of 100 numbers
  ## Q5 Extract all the numbers which is multiple of 5 but not of 3 between a sequence of 1 to 100
  ## Q6 Run : 'letters' command on console see what it is printing. Extract all the alphabets which are positioned at even number locations
  ## Q7 Replace all the upcase 'M' to a lowercase 'm' : c('muMbai', 'BoMbay', 'muMbaikar', 'Majhi muMbai') : use gsub
  ## Q8 Replace all the ? with + symoble in given string: c('2 ? 10', '3 ? 30'): Answer should be: "2 + 10" "3 + 30"
